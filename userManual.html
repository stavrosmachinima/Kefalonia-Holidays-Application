<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"><B>FIRST STEPS</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER></CENTER><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">To use the application, you will need the following tools / knowledge:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">1) Simple knowledge of User-Interfaces</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">For example you can press buttons and they may make different reactions. For example they can move or calculate among other things. There are also many clickable images that can be seen by the change of the mouse shape to a pointer.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">2) Understanding Constraints</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The simulations do not reflect reality, but it takes a bit of imagination to see how they work.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">For example, many times the application waits for the user to enter a voice message, but obviously the voice message will not be real, as there is no proper technical support to receive the voice message.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">3) Expectations</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Many times different users imagine that the application works differently, as everyone perceives reality in their own way.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">To solve the above problem, the User-Manual has been created that explains in detail how the application works, as well as this Help, to help users understand how these simulations work for their best service and user experience.

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"><B>Menu</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER></CENTER><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The application consists of a set of 5 simulations.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Each simulation runs independently and is not connected in any way with its previous or next.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The image of the main menu can be seen below.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="mainMenu.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The image contains the following sections.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">1) Application</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">2) Home gone Smart</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">3) Smart Entrance</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">4) Smart Services for Old People</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">5) Delivery gone Smart</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">6) Smart Planning</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><B>Mute/Unmute Button:</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Also the user can change at every moment if she wants to hear soft music by clicking this button.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="eisagogi.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The image above welcomes users to the app, giving them an idea of what it is planning to present.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">For example all these electronic devices are making the house look "smart", also the user has a lot of these applications at his disposal, making the user to imagine the future.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The purpose of the student at this page is to analyze the general purpose of the application, what steps it takes to achieve the goal, as well as to make users to imagine for themselves the cases it may present and make them think about how human needs can be solved in a futuristic "Smart Age".&nbsp;

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"><B>Home Gone Smart</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">This is the first simulation that appears on the menu from left to right. We can see an overview of the house right here.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="overview.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Every button and image is clickable.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">1) User clicks the on/off image:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">&nbsp;Then the light of the room is on or off depending on what picture appears on the overview.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">2) The user clicks room button:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="roomDarkLight.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Then as we can see from the picture at the right side of the page appears the state of the room that is curretly in. The room light may be on or off, depending on if the user has changed its state or the default state</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">3) The user clicks the temperature buttons:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Then the temperature of the room changes depending on its default state(differs from room to room). The temperature of a room doesn't change if the user clicks another room.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">4) The user presses the slideshow button:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Then a random room appears and it randomly swaps from room to room showing its temperature and its state.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">5) The user presses the normal button:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Then no action is made if it's already in normal mode, otherwise it changes to normal mode from the slideshow mode.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="door.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">This is the first thing the user sees. Well, the user needs to click at the doorknob to move to the next step.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">After clicking, the user opens the door and sees the bright status of her temperature on top of a machine.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Then a screen appears, with 4 different scenarios.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">1)The user has low temperature and she can pass.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">2)The user has moderate temperature and she needs to wait sometime until she can do it again.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">3)The user has light fever suggesting caution.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="covidScreen.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">4)The user has fever and then a self-test appears along with information about the closest diagnostic centers in case the user is positive on the self-test.

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"><B>Smart Sevices for Old People</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The first thing a user sees is a camera on a room. This room is supposed to be the main room of any apartment, probably containg the living room and/or the dining room.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The camera is only on the main room, because other rooms such as bathroom and bedrooms are considered private and people are not allowed to put the surveillance cameras in there as it is forbidden by State Law to collect personal information.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">For the purposes of this simulation it is supposed to be only on the living room.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">When a camera doesn't notice the user for a long time, then a Question appears on the control panel and a friendly female voice asks the elderly if they are okay.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">If the elderly don't respond in a specified time, then the local medical authorites are informed to come and check the situation. This is the default case. The user can also make it to call family relatives instead of the local authorities first and only if they dont pick up, the local authorities are informed.

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="supermarket.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Then you have the option of choosing from a variety of products that are available in the store.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">Make notice though, you have to buy at least one piece of something to forward your process.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">You use the + and the - sign to increase or decrease the amount you are going to buy. You can see the amount you will buy in the textboxes.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">You can't change the text in the textboxes though.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The user opens his cellphone, finds messages application and types 13033 as the recipient. Then, as you can see in the picture, the user can type her schedule according to the form that the user can minimize by pressing the - sign.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">For the purposes of this Help we will enter the same message as the form. You should also take care so that the schedule will not be able to process more than 3 activities at a given day. This functionality is coming on to the next update.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="pickAtransport.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">After the user clicks 'Send', the user has to decide what transport she will use for every different place she has on her schedule for the day.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="pickAplace.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">After the user clicks 'Next' she has to choose the destination on the Google Maps application.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The google map sign in her cellphone appears and the user has to click on it to open the application. Afterwards she can choose her destination on the maps and then hit 'Send'.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The user has to repeat the above process for every different place she will visit during her day.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">As the last step the user has the opportunity to enter notes or any limitations for the algorithm to take note of.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">The user clicks on the next image and the placeholder disappears. The placeholder can be seen with the Light Italic Font it uses.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="notes.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4"><IMG SRC="bestDestination.PNG" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">At the finale, the user can see the best route the program found for her own destinations and also the algorithm proposes a schedule for the user.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">For the purposes of this simulation, the application uses as first location the user's home which is calculated randomly on the map.
